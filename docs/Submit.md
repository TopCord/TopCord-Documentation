## Submitting Your Bot
A step-by-step guide to listing your bot at TopCord

### 1) Join Our Discord Server
One of the requirements for your bot to be tested is to be in the [Official TopCord Discord Server](https://discord.gg/kHpfdZ6XyX). This enables us to work out issues with the bot in the review process as well as inform you of important information as it is released.

### 2) Go to the submit page
We're sure you've done this already but in case a few of you haven't, head on over to the [submit page](https://topcord.xyz/bot/add) to get started with your bot submission.

### 3) Bot information
The site will ask for your bot's information such as Client ID, prefix, library, long and short description, invite link, support server, website, tags, and webhook url.

## How to Write a Good description
We at TopCord would like to make it very clear that **we are picky** when it comes to bot descriptions. If you don't have time to write a good description you likely don't have time to actively maintain your bot, and what's the use in that? To make it clear what we want in your description we've outline the requirements below with a few good examples.

### A Good Description
- Be a **decent** length! What we approve one bot for, will not always get your bot approved for if it lacks length!
- Explains why your bot is good.
- Talks about your bots key features.
- Convinces a user to invite your bot.
- Uses images to show how the bot works.
- Has a command list to make it easy for users to use your bot.
- Is not a Giant Block Of Text. Use 2 blank lines or `<br>`'s depending on the renderer.
